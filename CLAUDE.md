## Project Overview

**Auteurium** is a web application for creating text snippets and organizing them visually on a canvas with logical connections. The application is built with a complete AWS serverless architecture and React frontend, ready for development and testing.

### Core Concept
- Users create text snippets within projects
- Snippets are positioned on a visual canvas (similar to Miro/FigJam)
- Snippets can be connected with directional, many-to-many relationships
- Each snippet has a primary text field (textField1) and a title field, plus tags/categories
- Inline editing of title and text directly on canvas nodes (click to edit, Cmd/Ctrl+Enter to save)
- Canvas supports zooming, panning, and drag-and-drop positioning

## Architecture

**Monorepo Structure**: All components (frontend, backend, infrastructure) will be organized in a single GitHub repository

**Technology Stack**:
- **Frontend**: React with React Flow for canvas interactions, Tailwind CSS for styling, AWS Amplify v6
- **Backend**: AWS Lambda (Node.js with TypeScript), GraphQL resolvers
- **API Layer**: GraphQL with AWS AppSync
- **Authentication**: AWS Cognito with JWT validation
- **Storage**: DynamoDB with Global Secondary Indexes (designed for Neptune migration)
- **Infrastructure**: AWS CDK for Infrastructure as Code
- **Hosting**: Amazon S3 + CloudFront (disabled for development security)

## Key Application Features

### User Management
- Self-registration with email/password
- Admin users with system analytics access (cannot view snippet content)
- All user data is private and scoped to individual users

### Project Organization
- Users can create multiple projects
- Snippets, tags, and categories are project-specific
- Project deletion cascades to all contained snippets

### Snippet Management
- Each snippet has a title field and primary text field (textField1), no length limits (expected up to page length)
- Unique alphanumeric IDs displayed on canvas (shortened to 8 characters)
- Large snippets (>100 words) shown minimized with expand modal
- Version history with revert capability
- Positioned freely on infinite canvas
- **Inline Editing**: Click title or text field directly on canvas node to edit, Cmd/Ctrl+Enter to save, Esc to cancel
- **Connected Content Aggregation**: Snippets automatically aggregate content from upstream connections
- **Prompt Designer**: Interactive prompt builder for AI generation with connected content preview
- **AI-Powered Image Generation**: Multiple models (Google Imagen 4 Fast, Gemini 2.5 Flash Image with multimodal support for up to 3 connected images)
- **Text-to-Text Generation**: LLM-powered snippet creation with model selection
- **Model Selection**: Choose text, image, or video models directly on snippet nodes
- **Optimistic Updates**: Instant UI feedback with background synchronization

### Connection System
- Directional relationships between snippets (A depends on B)
- Many-to-many connections supported
- Connection labels/tags for relationship types
- Connections created by entering target snippet ID
- Visual lines drawn between connected snippets

### Canvas Interface
- Infinite scrollable workspace per project
- Pan and zoom controls
- Drag-and-drop snippet positioning
- Context menus for snippet operations
- Modal dialogs for editing and connection management

## Architecture Notes

**Data Model**:
- Users → Projects → Snippets (1:many relationships)
- Snippets have directional many-to-many connections with optional labels
- Project-scoped tags/categories
- Snippet versioning with revert capability
- One primary text field per snippet, positioned on infinite canvas

**Frontend Architecture**:
- React 19.2 with React Flow for canvas interactions, React Router for navigation
- AWS Amplify v6 for authentication integration with Cognito and GraphQL operations with AppSync (recently migrated from Apollo Client)
- **Feature-based Folder Structure**: Organized by domain (features/canvas/, features/projects/, shared/)
- **State Management**: Zustand stores for canvas, modals, prompts, optimistic updates, and toasts
- Optimistic UI updates for improved user experience
- Tailwind CSS for styling
- Authentication context with useAuth hook
- **Shared Component Library**: Reusable UI components (Button, Modal, Card, Input, Textarea, Toast, LoadingSpinner)
- **Custom Hooks Library**: useLocalStorage, useDebounce, useMediaQuery, useKeyPress, useGraphQLQueryWithCache
- **Centralized Constants**: Canvas config, validation rules, UI settings in shared/constants/
- **Error Boundaries**: Global and feature-level error handling with fallback UI

**Backend Architecture**:
- GraphQL API via AWS AppSync with Lambda resolvers organized by domain
- Resolver organization: Each domain (project, snippet, connection, user, genai) has separate mutations.ts and queries.ts
- DynamoDB with 6 tables (users, projects, snippets, connections, versions, generations) and Global Secondary Indexes
- AWS Cognito for authentication with JWT validation using aws-jwt-verify
- User data isolation: users can only access their own projects/snippets
- S3 for media uploads with pre-signed URLs (private bucket) and upload completion handlers
- GenAI integration with multiple LLM providers (Google Gemini, OpenAI) for image and text generation via genai-orchestrator service
- Secrets Manager for secure LLM API key storage
- CloudWatch for logging (monitoring stack disabled for cost savings)

**Critical Implementation Areas**:
- **Authentication**: AWS Cognito integration, admin users cannot access snippet content
- **Cascade Deletes**: Project deletion removes all snippets and connections (complete cascade deletion implemented with fix 1bc0934)
- **Media Handling**: Direct S3 uploads via pre-signed URLs (private bucket), backend registration on completion
- **Image Generation**: Multi-model support including Google Imagen 4 Fast, Gemini 2.5 Flash Image with multimodal capabilities using genai-orchestrator
- **Text Generation**: LLM-powered text-to-text generation for snippet creation using configurable models
- **Data Validation**: Zod schemas in packages/validation for consistent validation
- **Error Handling**: Consistent API error format, comprehensive CloudWatch logging
- **Infrastructure**: CDK stacks with app-specific resource naming for multi-app AWS accounts
- **Cost Optimization**: Monitoring stack disabled during development (~$5-7/month savings)
- **Resolver Pattern**: Domain-based organization with mutations.ts and queries.ts per feature area

**Build Dependencies**:
1. packages/shared-types → packages/validation → packages/graphql-schema
2. services/genai-orchestrator (depends on shared-types, validation)
3. services/api (depends on packages + genai-orchestrator)
4. apps/web (depends on packages)
5. infrastructure/aws-cdk (independent, can be built separately)

## Infrastructure Testing Framework

**TDD Approach**: The CDK infrastructure uses Test-Driven Development with comprehensive test coverage to prevent regressions and ensure consistency across all AWS stacks.

**Key Testing Commands** (from infrastructure/aws-cdk/):
- `npm test -- auth-stack.test.ts` - Test specific stack
- `npm test -- --testNamePattern="Node.js"` - Test with pattern matching
- `npm test -- --changedSince=origin/main` - Test only changed files
- `export RUN_DEPLOYMENT_TESTS=true && npm run test:validation` - Validate deployed infrastructure

**Critical Test Areas**:
- **Runtime Version Safety**: Prevents regression to older Node.js versions (enforces 22.x)
- **Security Compliance**: IAM permissions, CORS configuration, authentication setup
- **Resource Integrity**: Naming conventions, cross-stack references, environment variables
- **Template Validation**: CDK Template assertions for all AWS resources

**Test Configuration**: Tests use Jest with ts-jest preset, separate tsconfig in test/tsconfig.json

## Monitoring Configuration

**Current Status**: CloudWatch monitoring stack is DISABLED for development cost savings (~$5-7/month)

**Re-enabling Monitoring** (when ready for production):
1. Rename `infrastructure/aws-cdk/lib/stacks/auteurium-monitoring-stack.ts.disabled` to `.ts`
2. Uncomment monitoring lines in `infrastructure/aws-cdk/lib/auteurium-app.ts`
3. Run: `cdk deploy Auteurium-Monitoring-dev`

**Monitoring Features** (when enabled):
- Custom CloudWatch dashboard with API and CloudFront metrics
- Automated alerts for API errors (>5 errors) and high latency (>5 seconds)
- SNS notifications for production issues
- Centralized logging with configurable retention
